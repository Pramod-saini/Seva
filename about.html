        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Ananda Seva began in a small village in Rajasthan, where our founder Priya Sharm witnessed the challenges faced by rural communities. Inspired by the principle of "seva" (selfless service), she gathered a group of like minded individuals committed to creating positive change.</p> <br>


       <p>What started as a small initiative to provide clean water to one village has grown into a nationwide movement with over 500 volunteers working across 15 states in India. Our holistic approach addresses the interconnected challenges of education, healthcare, water access, and sustainable livelihoods.</p>
